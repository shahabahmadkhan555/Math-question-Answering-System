# Math-question-Answering-System
1. Built a system to answer closed and open vocabulary algebra problems.
2. Used Brill’s tagger with unigram model for Part of Speech tagging. The accuracy achieved by Brill’s tagger was 80.6
3. Used Support Vector Machine to classify the type of question and then regex to transform questions in natural language to a fixed schema.
4. Model achieved a test accuracy of 0.85 by correctly evaluating 170 out 200 questions.
5. Tech stack used was Tensorflow, NLTK, Scipy, Keras and Python.
